# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY FIX - JavaScript Loading Issue

## Problem Identified
The site is showing chunk loading errors because security headers were blocking Next.js static assets.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Redeploy with Fixed Configuration
Your code now has the correct configuration. **Deploy immediately** by:

1. Push these changes to your Git repository
2. Or trigger manual deploy in Netlify Dashboard

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Netlify Dashboard â†’ Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables:

NODE_ENV=production
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Security Headers**: Removed `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` that was blocking JS files
2. **Static Asset Handling**: Excluded `/_next/static/*` from strict headers
3. **Netlify Configuration**: Updated to properly handle Next.js chunks
4. **PWA Configuration**: Fixed build excludes and caching

## Test After Deployment

1. Visit: https://ayeshaacademypurnea.online
2. Check browser console - should be no chunk loading errors
3. Test login with: Mobile: `8888888888`, Password: `student123`

## If Still Not Working

1. **Clear Site Cache**:
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard â†’ Site Settings â†’ Build & Deploy
   - Click "Clear cache and deploy site"

2. **Check Deploy Logs**:
   - Netlify Dashboard â†’ Deploys â†’ Click latest deploy
   - Look for any build errors

3. **Browser Cache**:
   - Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Try incognito/private browsing

The JavaScript chunk loading errors should be completely resolved after redeployment with these fixes.
